The coarse search method for finding the optimal combination of migration rates has overstayed its welcome. As the number of migration rates grows, this method is not going to be able to keep up and it will need to become more imprecise. We could either find the MLE through a hill climbing algorithm or use MCMC to sample the posterior. I'm more interested in the latter, but I was worried how difficult this might be to implement. Luckily, I found the Python package `emcee` which was very easy to set up with `terracotta`. This devlog will focus on how I did that and an explanation of the sampling strategy that `emcee` uses (as, spoiler, it is not a Metropolis-Hastings sampler).
