Above is an example `demes.tsv`. Currently, deme types are given one type for the whole back propagation. You could see a scenario where conditions change over time, constituting a need for a different migration rate and therefore deme type. If only one number is given, we can assume that the rate is the same the whole time. Alternatively, if type is set to `0:0,100:4`, I am saying that from 0 to 100 generations before present, the deme is of type `0`, then deeper than 100 generations, it is of type `4`. This ensures that types are shared across epochs, which will give more power to the estimates. So far this seems like the most compact way of doing this, as the connections don't change between epochs, so we don't want a completely new `demes.tsv` file. This format won't make sense to the `pandas`, so further processing will be required to get these into `WorldMap.connections`. Rather than `WorldMap.connections` being a single `pandas.DataFrame`, it needs to be a list with associated epochs.
