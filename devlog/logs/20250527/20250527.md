### From 2025-05-27 to 2025-06-20

I've implemented many speed improvements including calculating the tree likelihoods in parallel using Numba, a Python package for accelerated vector and matrix calculations. This required rewriting some of the functions to use more primitive objects (Numba does not understand what a dictionary is, let alone a `tskit.TreeSequence`). Even with these improvements, estimation with MCMC was quite slow, so I decided to switch to a hill-climbing algorithm (`scipy.optimize.minimize`). This function minimizes a user specified function, in this case `calc_migration_rate_log_likelihood()`; as a note, technically, we would want to maximize the log-likelihood, so I just flipped the sign of the value returned so that we can minimize instead.

There was a bug when multiple samples were assigned to the same deme. Migration estimates were extremely high, leading me to suspect that there was a mismatch in sample IDs where samples that should have been in the same deme according to the tree were being assigned to separate demes. A fast coalescent event would therefore require a very fast migration, increasing the estimates when in reality these samples shouldn't be very informative about the migration rate. I was mistakenly misordering the samples when initializing the `msprime` simulation, which caused IDs to be wrong. After correcting this, I simulated trees under a specified migration rate on the world map using the sample positions from Wohns et al. I used a population size of 500 for all of the demes. I then used `terracotta` to estimate the migration rate based on the trees.

The dashed line is the 1:1 comparison between true and estimated migration rates. The colored points represent the to sampling schemes that I used. Purple is where I first limited to max one sample per deme before simulating the trees (~75 samples). Yellow uses all (nearly 2000) samples from the Wohns et al. dataset filtered to mainland African, Asia, and Europe. `terracotta` underestimates the rates in the yellow scenario, which is not necessarily seen in the purple. I didn't necessarily expect to see a difference between the sampling methods, but a justification could be that a lower migration rate allows samples that start in the same deme to not migrate as far from one another before coalescing. When samples all start in separate demes, there isn't as much risk of over-dispersing.
