- Sample locations from map builder

### From 2025-04-23 to 2025-04-30

I've been back and forth on this, but I think that it'll be cleaner in the long run to have the samples as part of the `WorldMap`. Previously, I didn't want to do this because I've been using random sample locations which are calculated alongside the trees. But now that I can generate maps and place samples, I need a way to estimate trees with those specified sample locations. My thought now is to generate the samples file, with either random or specified positions, and then pass that into the `WorldMap` alongside the demes file. I've made the samples file optional (defaults to `None`). With this update, there's a few coinciding changes:

- `WorldMap.draw()` no longer takes the parameter `samples` as this is passed within the `WorldMap` itself.
- `WorldMap.build_sample_location_vectors()` can now be a "private" function.
- `calc_migration_rate_log_likelihood()` and `calc_generalized_migration_rate_log_likelihood()` no longer takes the parameter `sample_location_vectors`.
