### From 2025-02-10 to 2025-02-23

When I first started this project, I had wanted to use the graphical structure of the ARG to estimate the migration surface and location of ancestors rather than individual trees. I've since decided to start with individual trees and make sure everything is working properly (a major task within itself) before trying to tackle the harder graphical structure that I predict will have some rabbit holes. Here's a recap of some of my previous findings as well as a short investigation into what I predict will be a problem with using the graphical structure of ARGs in `terracotta`.

There are two algorithms for Belief Propagation on graphs: junction tree and loopy belief propagation (LBP). LBP is an efficient approximate algorithm that may be helpful in the future but I'm not going to discuss right now. The junction tree algorithm is an exact algorithm but very inefficient so will likely not be useful beyond small tests. You can apply the junction tree algorithm to an ARG by "unfolding" the graph at recombination nodes. Below is an example for a two sample, two tree ARG:

$$L_{4}(i) = \sum_{x \in \text{demes}}{Pr(x|i,G')L_2(x)}$$

where

$$L_{2}(i) = \sum_{x \in \text{demes}}{Pr(x|i,t_{0,2})L_0(x)}$$.

The second equation calculates the likelihood of the location of Node 2 given the location of Node 0, which is its only child in the tree. Once we have the likelihood of the location of Node 2, we can unfold the tree, splitting Node 2 into two tips that have the same position. I define this tree as G'. We can then calculate the location of Node 4 (root) using the standard algorithm from `terracotta` but run multiple times for all of the possible positions of Node 2. Lastly, we scale the probability by the original likelihood of Node 2's position to get the final likelihood for the position of Node 4 (root).

With Brownian motion on ARGs (`sparg`), we saw that as you weave more trees into the graph, the MLE of dispersal rate necessarily increases. This is poor behavior as looking at more data should not bias your estimates to always be higher. I am concerned that this may not just be an issue unique to Brownian motion but could also encompass other movement models, such as that used by `terracotta`. We've previously talked about using the trees to estimate the migration surface and then using the ARG to estimate the locations of ancestors given that migration surface, but if this bias between trees and ARGs exists for `terracotta`, we may be getting poor results combining them.

I want to measure the MLE of the migration rate using the individual trees versus the ARG for this simple scenario. Say the samples are placed in Demes 3 and 6 along a line of 10 demes with migration only to the neighbors.
